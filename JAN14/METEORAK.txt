ANS: INTERNATIONAL TOURNAMENT IN INFORMATICS shumen 2011 problem(senior section).

There is a rectangular box size NxM. Some of the cells in it are "dangerous". only
there are exactly K such cells. Also there is a query Q, each has the form Li Hi. The answer to
inquiry of this type is the maximum possible area of a rectangle such that it
lies in the strip with Li-th in Hi-th row inclusive and does not contain a "dangerous" cells.

input:
The first line of input contains the number N, M and K, respectively, separated by single
spaces.
The following K lines contain different pairs of numbers xi yi - coordinates of the "dangerous" cells.
The next line contains the number of Q - the number of requests.
Followed by Q lines, each sets the query in the form of Li Hi.
